# Report introduction
introduction: |
  {scope_intro}:

  - JIRA Metrics Report: reflects requirement flow, delivery rhythm, and bottlenecks
  - GitHub PR Metrics Report: reflects development behavior, code changes, and collaboration patterns

  Analyze both reports together to produce a single, concise executive summary.

# Analysis sections (Executive Summary Style)
sections:
  key_trends:
    title: "1. Key Trends Across Projects and Phases"
    description: |
      Summarize overall delivery trends, project-specific characteristics, and capacity-adjusted throughput.
      Highlight differences between projects (e.g., stalled vs active) and emergent patterns when aggregated.
    instructions: |
      - Focus on total issue throughput, capacity-adjusted throughput, and PR throughput.
      - Compare phases and highlight key changes.
      - Keep each observation to 1–2 sentences.

  jira_pr_insights:
    title: "2. JIRA ↔ PR Insights"
    description: |
      Analyze meaningful correlations and divergences between JIRA and PR metrics.
      Focus on:
        - In Progress Avg Time ↔ PR development/merge times
        - Review / Release Pending Avg Time ↔ PR review metrics
        - Capacity-adjusted throughput
      Highlight cases where PR improvements do not translate to issue delivery.

  ai_impact:
    title: "3. AI Impact"
    description: |
      Evaluate how AI-assisted work affects PR size, merge speed, review complexity, and coordination costs.

        - Related metrics
        - Whether AI is relevant
        - Clear next steps
# Output formatting requirements
output_format:
  style: "Executive Summary, plain text suitable for Google Sheets"
  formatting:
    - "Output must be plain text only; do not use Markdown, tables, pipes, or special formatting"
    - "Section headers should use simple numbered titles such as '1. Key Trends Across Projects and Phases'"
    - "Each numbered section must start with a short conclusion sentence"
    - "Metrics and trends must be embedded inline, for example: 'Throughput declined from 0.35 to 0.27 issues/day'"
    - "Use short bullet-like lines with '-' and ':' for subpoints; no indentation or bolding"
    - "Keep each paragraph or line short, readable in a single spreadsheet cell"
    - "Avoid Q&A style; report should read as a continuous leadership-friendly narrative"
    - "Include numeric comparisons, trends, and actionable insights inline"
    - "Output should cover key trends, JIRA ↔ PR insights, AI impact, project health, and priority actions, all in one-page Executive Summary style"

# Special instructions for aggregated vs single-team analysis
scope_variations:
  aggregated: "Executive summary for multiple teams/projects under 【{project_name}】 across {phase_description}"
