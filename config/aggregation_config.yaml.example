# Aggregation Configuration Example
# Location: config/engineering/aggregation_config.yaml
#
# Aggregates multiple sub-project reports into unified reports.
# Reads already-generated combined_*_report_*.tsv files (no API calls).

aggregation:
  # Name for the aggregated report
  name: "Engineering Team"

  # List of subdirectory names to aggregate
  # IMPORTANT: These are subdirectory names under config/engineering/,
  # NOT Jira project keys or GitHub repo names
  #
  # The tool reads from:
  #   - reports/frontend/jira_report_config.yaml
  #   - reports/frontend/pr_report_config.yaml
  #   - reports/backend/jira_report_config.yaml
  #   - reports/backend/pr_report_config.yaml
  #   - etc.
  projects:
    - "frontend"
    - "backend"
    - "mobile"

  # Optional: Exclude specific project/report-type combinations
  # Format: "{project-name}/{report-type}" where report-type is "jira" or "pr"
  # exclude:
     # - "mobile/jira"    # Skip Jira reports from mobile project
     # - "frontend/pr"    # Skip PR reports from frontend project

# Multiple scenario (required):
output_dir: "reports/engineering"

# delete old sheets with same name but different timestamp(Recommend)
replace_existing_reports: true

# Google Sheets settings (optional)
# google_spreadsheet_id: ""  # Google Spreadsheet ID for report upload
# If you do not set in Config PR, reports would be uploaded to the default google-sheet by CI.
# IMPORTANT: For custom sheets in CI, grant Editor access to: cara-google-sheet-sa@wlin-438107.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Local Development Advanced: Manual report file specification (uncommon)
# Use only for special cases like aggregating historical reports
# When specified, this overrides auto-discovery from 'projects'
#
# manual_reports:

#     - "reports/backend/jira/combined_jira_report_20241201_*.tsv"
