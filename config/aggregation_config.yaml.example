# Aggregation Configuration
# Aggregates multiple report directories into unified team-wide reports.
# Reads already-generated combined reports (no API calls needed).

aggregation:
  # Name for the aggregated report
  name: "Platform Team"

  # Output directory for aggregated reports
  output_dir: "reports/platform-aggregated"

  # List of report directory names to aggregate
  # These are directory names under reports/, not Jira projects or GitHub repos
  # For each directory, the tool looks for:
  # - reports/{directory}/jira/combined_jira_report_*.tsv
  # - reports/{directory}/github/combined_pr_report_*.tsv
  #
  # 💡 Google Sheets Tab Naming:
  # When uploading to Google Sheets, tab names are automatically prefixed with
  # the directory name to avoid conflicts.
  #
  # Example with same repo, different teams:
  #   - "backend-team" analyzing konflux-ui → Sheet tab: "backend-team konflux-ui PR Report - Team"
  #   - "frontend-team" analyzing konflux-ui → Sheet tab: "frontend-team konflux-ui PR Report - Team"
  #
  # This allows multiple teams to analyze the same repository without conflicts!
  #
  projects:
    - "backend"       # Aggregates reports from reports/backend/
    - "frontend"      # Aggregates reports from reports/frontend/
    # - "mobile"      # Add more report directories as needed

  # Optional: Exclude specific directory/report-type combinations
  # Format: "{directory-name}/{report-type}" where report-type is "jira" or "pr"
  exclude:
    # - "docs/jira"      # Exclude Jira reports from reports/docs/
    # - "mobile/pr"      # Exclude PR reports from reports/mobile/

  # Optional: Google Sheets settings for uploading aggregated reports
  # If not set, falls back to GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID environment variable
  # If neither is set, upload will be skipped (unless you use --no-upload)
  google_spreadsheet_id: ""  # Your Google Spreadsheet ID (optional)

# Advanced: Manually specify report files (local use only)
# Use cases:
#   - Aggregate specific historical reports (e.g., reports from different dates)
#   - Aggregate reports from non-standard locations
#   - Testing aggregation with specific report files
# NOT recommended for CI (use 'projects' for standard workflow)
# When specified, this overrides auto-discovery from 'projects'
# manual_reports:
#   jira:
#     - "reports/backend/jira/combined_jira_report_20241215_*.tsv"
#     - "reports/old-reports/jira/combined_jira_report_20241101_*.tsv"
#   pr:
#     - "reports/frontend/github/combined_pr_report_20241215_*.tsv"
#     - "/path/to/archived/reports/combined_pr_report_*.tsv"
