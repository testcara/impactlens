aggregation:
  # Name for the aggregated report
  name: "Engineering Team"

  # Output directory for aggregated reports
  output_dir: "reports/engineering-aggregated"

  # List of subdirectory names to aggregate
  # IMPORTANT: These are subdirectory names under config/engineering/,
  # NOT Jira project keys or GitHub repo names
  #
  # The tool reads from:
  #   - reports/frontend/jira/combined_jira_report_*.tsv
  #   - reports/frontend/github/combined_pr_report_*.tsv
  #   - reports/backend/jira/combined_jira_report_*.tsv
  #   - reports/backend/github/combined_pr_report_*.tsv
  #   - etc.
  projects:
    - "frontend"
    - "backend"
    - "mobile"

  # Optional: Exclude specific project/report-type combinations
  # Format: "{project-name}/{report-type}" where report-type is "jira" or "pr"
  exclude:
    # - "mobile/jira"    # Skip Jira reports from mobile project
    # - "frontend/pr"    # Skip PR reports from frontend project

  # Optional: Override GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID environment variable
  # Leave empty to use environment variable
  google_spreadsheet_id: ""

# Advanced: Manual report file specification (uncommon)
# Use only for special cases like aggregating historical reports
# When specified, this overrides auto-discovery from 'projects'
