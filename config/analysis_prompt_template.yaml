# Output format requirements
output_format:
  structure: |
    START with an EXECUTIVE SUMMARY section at the very top (before any numbered sections):

    ## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

    **Overall AI Impact**: [POSITIVE/NEGATIVE/MIXED] [brief qualifier]

    ✅ **Major Wins**: [2-3 key improvements with specific metrics]
    ⚠️ **Critical Risks**: [2-3 key concerns]
    🎯 **Biggest Opportunity**: [Single highest-impact improvement area]

    [1-2 paragraph narrative summary of overall findings]

    ---

    THEN provide the numbered sections as defined above.

    IMPORTANT: DO NOT add a "Summary" or "Conclusion" section at the end!
    The EXECUTIVE SUMMARY at the top is sufficient. End with the last numbered section.

  formatting_requirements:
    - "Format output as a clean, professional document suitable for reading in Google Sheets"
    - "Use PLAIN TEXT with minimal Markdown - avoid excessive asterisks, pipes, or special characters"
    - "Section headers: Use simple numbered format (1., 2., 3.) or clear titles without ## symbols"
    - "Paragraphs: Keep each paragraph 2-4 lines maximum, with blank lines between paragraphs"
    - "Lists: Use simple bullet format with - or • symbols, not complex markdown"
    - "Metrics: Present numbers inline with context, e.g. 'Daily throughput increased from 0.66 to 1.20 issues/day (+82%)'"
    - "Avoid long run-on sentences - break complex ideas into multiple short, clear sentences"
    - "NO pipes (|), NO tables, NO complex markdown formatting"
    - "Example of GOOD formatting:"
    - "  1. KEY FINDING"
    - "  "
    - "  The data shows a productivity paradox:"
    - "  - AI tools accelerate individual task completion (closure time reduced 30%)"
    - "  - Team-level throughput declined from 0.66 to 0.58 issues/day (-12%)"
    - "  "
    - "  This suggests two possible explanations:"
    - "  - Team is completing fewer but higher-quality issues"
    - "  - AI adoption overhead is temporarily impacting productivity"
    - "  "
    - "  The sharp increase in Waiting state time (15d to 27d) indicates coordination issues are the main bottleneck."

  focus_areas:
    - "Business impact: How does this affect delivery speed and quality?"
    - "Concrete actions: What specific steps should be taken?"
    - "Data-driven insights: Back up observations with specific metric changes"
  tone: "Professional but accessible tone suitable for engineering leadership"

# Optional: Custom focus areas (will be added to all analyses)

  CRITICAL: DATA ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS
  - The report uses TSV format with columns: Phase, team, [individual team members]
  - ALWAYS verify you are reading the correct column for each team member
  - When citing individual metrics, DOUBLE-CHECK the column position matches the member name
  - Example: If columns are "Phase team JoaoPedroPP Katka92 ... rakshett rrosatti sahil143"
    and data is "15.92d 20.48d ... 59.36d 15.82d 8.32d", then:
    - rakshett = 59.36d (NOT rrosatti)
    - rrosatti = 15.82d (NOT sahil143)
    - sahil143 = 8.32d

  CRITICAL: METRIC INTERPRETATION REQUIREMENTS

  1. VOLUME vs THROUGHPUT COMPARISON:
  - NEVER compare raw volumes across different time periods!
  - ALWAYS use daily/normalized rates when comparing periods of different lengths
  - Example of WRONG comparison:
    * No AI: 146 issues (220 days) vs Full AI: 120 issues (100 days)
    * WRONG conclusion: "Volume dropped 18%" ❌
  - Example of CORRECT comparison:
    * No AI: 146 ÷ 220 = 0.66 issues/day
    * Full AI: 120 ÷ 100 = 1.20 issues/day
    * CORRECT conclusion: "Daily throughput increased 82%" ✅
  - The report already provides "Daily Throughput" metrics - USE THOSE for comparisons!

  2. THROUGHPUT vs CYCLE TIME:
  - "Daily Throughput" = PRs/Issues completed per day = PRODUCTIVITY (higher is better)
  - "Avg Time to Merge/Closure" = Days from creation to completion = CYCLE TIME (individual lifecycle)
  - These metrics can move in OPPOSITE directions and both be positive:
    * High throughput + longer cycle time = More parallel work, higher WIP
    * Example: 0.66/d → 1.10/d (+67% throughput) + 13d → 17d merge time
      → Team is MORE productive (completing more), but individual items take longer
         (possibly due to more parallel work, CI queues, or deployment windows)

  3. REVIEW METRICS:
  - "Time to First Review" = Initial review responsiveness (lower is better)
  - DO NOT confuse "cycle time" with "review speed" - they measure different things!
  - When throughput increases but cycle time also increases, analyze WHY:
    * More parallel work in flight?
    * CI/deployment bottlenecks?
    * Longer lifecycle but faster actual review?
    * More iterations/improvements per item?

  IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
  - Only "No AI Period" represents development WITHOUT any AI tools (baseline)
  - All other periods use AI tools, just different combinations/levels
  - Analyze the PROGRESSION of AI tool adoption and its impact

  Pay special attention to:
  - Baseline comparison: No AI Period vs. any AI-enabled period
  - Evolution analysis: How metrics change as AI tool combinations evolve
  - Tool effectiveness: Which specific AI tool combinations work best
  - Individual adoption patterns: Who adapts well to different AI tools
  - Diminishing returns: Is more AI always better, or is there an optimal combination?
